**🚀 21 Days of RTL – QuickSilicon Challenge**

Welcome to my personal repository for the #21DaysOfRTL challenge by QuickSilicon! This project showcases my solutions to 21 hands-on RTL design and verification problems, all implemented in SystemVerilog. The challenge is designed to strengthen core digital design skills through practical exercises.

**📚 About the Challenge**

The 21 Days of RTL challenge is a free, self-paced course offered by QuickSilicon. It serves as an excellent starting point for those interested in RTL design and verification, covering a range of topics from basic components to more complex systems.

**🔍 What You'll Learn**

SystemVerilog constructs for synthesizable RTL design
Testbench development and simulation techniques.
Each module includes a design problem along with a corresponding testbench to validate functionality.

**📈 Progress Tracker**

Day	Module Description	Status
1	2:1 Multiplexer	✅ Done on 01st May, 2025
2	D Flip-Flop Variants	✅ Done 02nd May, 2025
3	Edge Detector	✅ Done 03rd May, 2025


📌 Notes
Each module is designed with synthesizability in mind.
Testbenches are created to validate functionality; however, passing compilation doesn't guarantee logical correctness.

Embarking on this challenge has been a rewarding experience, enhancing my understanding of RTL design and verification. I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for others on a similar learning path.

**Happy Coding! 🎉**
